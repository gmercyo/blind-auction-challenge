#Challenge: is to create a dictionary, where each person's name is the key and their bid will be the value

#after each bid is inputted, the user should be able to type 'yes' if there is someone else yet to bid or 'no' if they are the last bidder. 

#if the user clicks 'yes' the console should clear() so their bid remains a secret and if they answer 'no' the highest bidder and their bid can be printted.

# the last step will require the program to loop through the dictionary to find the highest value/bid
